# The .foreverignore file is formatted like a .gitignore file.
# It tells forever what things to ignore when using the forever --watch option.

# I don't use the -watch option so ignore this file.
# However you may get an error if forever can't find one.

# I couldn't get !**/*.js working - maybe ! not supported?
# **/*
# !**/*.js

# ignore all files ending in .log. .html, .css
**/*.log
**/*.html
**/*.css
